# Database-backed sales system (Computer Science 2 Final Project)
This database-backed sales system is designed to replace the old collection of Excel sheets and macros used previously by a fictional company called Modern Geek Games (MGG) in order to modernize and compete in the digital-copy only market. The system will identify items under three main categories, products, services, and subscriptions, with a unique alphanumeric code and a name.
